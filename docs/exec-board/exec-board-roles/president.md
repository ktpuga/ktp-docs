title: President
description: This role will drop your GPA. If everything fails you must stay on the ship as it sinks. You are the final line of defense to preserve what countless others have attributed sweat, tears, (and a little blood) to growing.

# El Presidente

- Your role is to be all-knowing (generally) with everything KTP. You must be a natural leader and a role model to those outside of KTP. Be kind, just, and **always vote last on decisions**. Why? The Executive board should generally be an odd amount of members, if voting is tied you should always be the tie breaker. You must be quick on your feet, methodical in decision making, kind, and just.
- The better you delegate tasks to your Eboad, Cabinet, Nationals, and General Body; the less work will be had for you (this is a good thing).

## Constitution

You must uphold the values of our constitution, this includes (but is not limited to) our code of conduct and behavior outside of the University of Georiga. The constitution acts as a framework that the founders and previous Eboard members have created to ensure an amazing experience.

## Work

While delegation is important, you must be present at many rush/PNM events. This includes all Info Sessions (If possible). Your voice, position, and comments are **the most** influential in the whole fraternity. Use this power wisely. Also, you are the main speaker for all: Chapter Meetings, Executive Board Meetings, and Special Meetings (see constitution).

## 📝 Tips for Incoming Presidents

- Listen to your Executive Board. If they aren't doing things that you want, ask them! Talk to them and show them they are important. Leverage their leadership to make cohesive decisions.
- Do not get walked over. If you lack seniority do not let that be a reason to be a yes-man, or conform to critique without considering your own perspectives and experience.
- If you have an Android, get an iPhone, if your iPhone is old, get a new one. You will be on your phone CONSTANTLY.
- Collaborate heavily with Technical Chairs, Project Leads, and the Research Lab team, you’ll get better engagement when people feel like they’re contributing to something bigger.
- Learn how to talk. You don't need to remove all the filler words in your speech, but it gets easier when you do it constantly for General Body Meetings.
- Do not pick anyone's side. Favoritism is an easy way to get an impeachment motion moved against you. Do not pick favorites. Have closer friends in KTP than others, but do not make decisions based on a minority of members because of personal relations.
- Leverage your position for Career positions. (Isn't that part of why you are so driven?) Yes. Reap the benefits. You will be working very hard for them anyways. Use your connections to help gain sponsors, company visits, and more for Kappa Theta Pi.
